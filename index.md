God never intended us to live alone.
At Joseph fellowship, we strive for genuine relationship in Christ
and compassion for each other and the community.

As a fellowship started out with 1.5 generation
and second generation immigrants,
we believe God is a barrier breaking God.
The gospel is meant for everyone regardless of
where you came from and the language you speak.
We hope to meet you and begin our
discipleship journey with Christ together.
